Lab work from Courseera

# Learning From This course 

## Week 1:

Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Understanding the transformer architecture that powers LLMs
Training and fine-tuning LLMs for specific use cases
Optimizing the model's objective function across dataset size, compute budget, and inference requirements
Exploring the challenges and opportunities of generative AI in businesses

## Week 2:

Multitask fine-tuning and its benefits
Avoiding catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning
Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as an alternative to full fine-tuning
Exploring different use cases of large language models
Evaluating and choosing the right model size for specific applications

## Week 3:

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align models with human values
Using LLMs as reasoning engines and creating agents
Responsible AI and the importance of ethical considerations
Evaluating model performance and alignment with human preferences
Optimizing models for deployment and integrating them into applications
Overcoming limitations of LLMs through advanced techniques
